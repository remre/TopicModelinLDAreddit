Topics modellings with LDA is mapping each text in the corpus to a set of topics which covers a good deal of the words in the document. There is no predefined class to determine. 
Database gathered from Reddit positive and negative comments database and ABC News.

We aimed to compare different approaches and different databases. Reddit classification notebook fed by positive and negative comments on Reddit which is used for sentiment analysis and mostly about daily concerns. In the ABC news, notebook content is more featured like coronavirus, crime, politics etc...

Also, bags of words and TF-IDF methods are handled separately to compare results.

Compared bubble diagrams show more intercepted ones in the Reddit database which could be interfered with as comment contents are somehow similar or at least not in very specific areas. Besides bubble dimensions demonstrate prevalency of the topic which is mostly bigger for ABC news.
